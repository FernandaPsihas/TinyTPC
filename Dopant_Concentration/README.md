# Dopant Concentration Code 

In the folder there are two .ipynb and two .py docuemnts. Since the code includes jupyter widgets the only way you can run this code is on a jupyter notebook.

### Description of both scripts.
1. The one titled Concentration_code allows you to know the concentration in ppm of a dopant in LAr given that you put in a certain mass of an Argon-Dopant mixture into the LAr cryostat.
2. the other script allows you knwo the required mass of the mixture that you need to put into the LAr cryostat given a final desired dopant concentration in ppm
